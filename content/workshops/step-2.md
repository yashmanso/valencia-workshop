the situation

students have learned about some concept, this is to say that they can define and

explain it. but, they haven’t yet made the concept their own in practice.

what is the student actually struggling with (e.g., perception, motivation, confidence,

etc.)?

which tool would you put in their hands and why this one at this moment?

how would you include the tool in your practice?

what would they be able to do at the end that they couldn’t before?

would you adapt/modify something in the tool to make it fit better?
