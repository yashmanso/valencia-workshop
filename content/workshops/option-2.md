(what should we provide users to be able to adapt the tools to their context)

- take a tool/model/method that you are familiar with

- understand the designers’ design choices and intentions

- choose a different context than their intentions

- try to make adjustments to make it useful for other context

- reflect on things needed to be done in the translations process
