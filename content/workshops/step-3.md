pair with someone and discuss these

-how was it to find a tool that fits the learning purpose (not just the topic)?

-what information about a tool did you need that wasn’t there?

-is there a difference between a tool useful for doing and one useful for learning?

-what would need to change in how tools are presented in the toolbox to make this

kind of search easier?
